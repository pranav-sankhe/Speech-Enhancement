\chapter{Speech Enhancement by Spectral Subtraction}

\section{Theory}
Spectral Subtraction is a widely used algorithm for speech enhancement due to it's simplicity if implementation.\\ 

Given our assumption of the additive property of noise and the linearity property of fourier transform, we have the following: 

$$ Y(e^{j\omega}) = X(e^{j\omega}) + N(e^{j\omega}) $$ 

where, 
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Y(e^{j\omega})$ is the fourier transform of the noisy signal 
	\item $X(e^{j\omega})$ is the fourier transform of the clean signal
	\item $N(e^{j\omega})$ is the fourier transform of the noise
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} In speech analysis by the virtute of the non-stationarity of the speech signal, we compute the short-time fourier transform instead of fourier transform to have a frequency vs time representation. 


The short time fourier spectrum of the noise signal is estimated with the the spectra measured within a noise-only segment of the speech
