\chapter{Speech Enhancement by Spectral Subtraction}

\section{Theory}
Spectral Subtraction is a widely used algorithm for speech enhancement due to it's simplicity if implementation.\\ 

Given our assumption of the additive property of noise and the linearity property of fourier transform, we have the following: 

$$ Y(e^{j\omega}) = X(e^{j\omega}) + N(e^{j\omega}) $$
